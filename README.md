# mixed messages

First portfolio project for my full stack course on codecademy.

It is a simple message generator written in javascript and executed with Node.js in the shell.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed ([find it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))

How to use it:
- Clone repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:poechlauerbe/mixed_messages.git
```
- go into the directory:
```
cd mixed_messages
```
- execute the message generator
```
node message-generator.js
```

You get a random quote of a leader and a random suggestion how to work with it.
The suggestions are created with ChatGPT.

Have fun!
